# Football_data

This project scrapes data from football-data.co.uk, and parses the data into dataframes for analysis using explore_football_110118.py. All data is saved into a local directory defined by the user CSV_data/league... There is also a dash dashboard which runs on a local host to visualise the data using dash_scatter2_v2.py.
